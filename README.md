## Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is often used to test basic programming ability.
1. The programmer is asked to make a program that counts to 100.
2. replace numbers devisable by three with the word "fizz".
3. Replace numbers devisable by five with the word "buzz".
4. Numbers divisible by both become "fizz buzz".

I have worked with a handful of languages over the last few years.
For fun I have written fizz buzz examples for the following languages:

* [Python](fizzbuzz.py)
* [Java](fizzbuzz.java)
* [Java Script](fizzbuzz.js)
* [Ruby](fizzbuzz.rb)
* [HTML + CSS](fizzbuzz.html)
